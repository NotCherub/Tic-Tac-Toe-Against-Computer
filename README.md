# Tic-Tac-Toe-Against-Computer
This is the log file for my CSE2003 project named as "Tic-Tac-Toe Against Computer". Code name for this project will be "TTT".The program would be fairly basic and will be designed in C language.

The program would have two segments namely, Multiplayer and one Player.

##Multiplayer
This segment of the program would enable user to play the program against hus friend. This part of program would be designed by Subodh Verma.

##Single Player
The strategies of this part and coding bith will be done by me. The computer would aim to defeat the player or rather bring the match to tie atleast.

The user can save the progress and win-lose points and continue from where he left off.
